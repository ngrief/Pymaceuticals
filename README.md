# Pymaceuticals
Model 5 challenge 
# PyMaceuticals Project

## Overview
PyMaceuticals is a data analysis project focused on evaluating the effects of drug treatments on tumor volume in mice. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project analyzes experimental data to determine the efficacy of different drug regimens in treating cancer.

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pymaceuticals
```
Open Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Data & Methodology
The dataset consists of records of mice treated with different drug regimens. The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Summary statistics
- Tumor volume comparison across treatments
- Survival rate analysis
- Scatter and regression modeling of drug effectiveness

## Key Findings
- **Capomulin** was observed to be one of the most effective treatments, significantly reducing tumor volume over time.
- **Weight and Tumor Volume Correlation:** Heavier mice tended to have larger tumors.
- **Visualizations & Insights:** Box plots, scatter plots, and trend lines effectively depict treatment performance.

## Usage
This project is useful for:
- Data science learners exploring Python-based data analysis
- Pharmaceutical analysts seeking insights into drug efficacy
- Researchers interested in tumor growth modeling
